# Contributing to Laravel Deadlock

Thanks for considering contributing to Laravel Deadlock  
Contributions of all kinds are welcome ideas, bug reports, documentation improvements, and code.

## Philosophy

Laravel Deadlock exists to make technical debt **explicit, time-boxed, and enforceable**.
When contributing, please keep the focus on:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Explicit behavior over magic
- Developer ergonomics in real projects

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have an idea:
- Search existing issues first
- Clearly describe the problem or use case
- Include Laravel and PHP versions when relevant

Feature requests are welcome, but they should align with the core goal:
**making temporary workarounds visible and enforceable**.

## Proposing Changes

Before opening a large pull request:
- Open an issue to discuss the idea
- Explain the problem you’re trying to solve
- Describe how your change fits the package’s purpose

This helps avoid wasted effort on both sides.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:
- Keep changes focused and small
- Add or update tests when behavior changes
- Update documentation if needed
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages

Pull requests that improve readability, error messages, or developer experience are especially appreciated.

## Coding Style

- Follow Laravel and PSR conventions
- Prefer simple, readable code
- Avoid introducing unnecessary abstractions

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive.
Disagreement is fine — personal attacks are not.

Thanks again for your interest in Laravel Deadlock.
Every contribution helps make technical debt more intentional.
